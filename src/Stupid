While playing I spent some, not very small, amunt of time on the forum searching for help

- First quest (move to place near Norhwatch) should contain more info, since the player can't read the list by opening inventory. I hide HUD a lot and spent some amount of time trying to get why the elves in the Northwatch not waiting for anyone

- On the forum I found that there is a second after-caged-part, the 'Do come back' letter on the chest near cage. I can't find the connection between first nad the second part of the quest.. Returned the Winking Skeever again - nobody there.. Or the message means that the player should go back to the Riften? 


Bundle ot not to?

-No-. While bundling is convinience for users, and harmless for resources like 3D resources, ESP files, it may casue issues in case of complex mod being bundled. As it may freeze a bugs in time (X bundles Y containing some old issues, fixed long ago), may cause downgrade issue (mod X capable to update itself from an older version, but not vica versa). The more mods dependent on a shared resource the more 'noticeable' the issue.
